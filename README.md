Description:
Designed a two-stage CMOS operational amplifier using TSMC 180nm technology. The amplifier met performance targets of >54 dB gain, >50° phase margin, and >10 V/µs slew rate. The design utilized differential pair input, gain boosting via cascode topology, and low-power biasing. Comprehensive simulation verified AC gain, transient behavior, and stability metrics, making it suitable for analog signal processing tasks
